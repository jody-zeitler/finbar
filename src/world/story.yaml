        Your brain is awake. It directs your eyes to open slowly and take in the place where
        it left your body. The eyes, however, see nothing: the room is completely dark. Your
        body is wrapped up in a blanket that keeps it at a cozy temperature. This is offset
        by a pounding sensation in the skull. It must have been thrown against an immovable
        object, or absorbed too many alcohol molecules. In either case, moving is not in the
        best interest of any part of you.

        - Yes, why waste energy moving around?
        - The bed is just the right consistency and temperature.
        - Perhaps getting up is the wrong choice.

        You swing your feet around and plant them on the floor, tilting your torso into an upright
        position and elevating your head. An involuntary groan escapes your throat.

        You're in a sparse but modern bedroom. Everything connected to the floor begins with wood
        paneling. The walls hold a strip of light at waist level, and continue on to the ceiling
        with a unprovoking solid brown paint layer.

        A bed is built into the center of the room. There are doors to a bathroom and to the outside,
        presumably.

        A light switch is on the wall. Flicking it reveals a sparse but modern bedroom. Everything
        connected to the floor begins with wood paneling. The walls hold a strip of light at waist
        level, and continue on to the ceiling with a unprovoking solid brown paint layer.

      This is a bathroom. A small shower, short toilet and a countertop with a sink are crammed into
      the available space. A mirror takes up an entire wall.

        As you gaze up into the mirror with simple curiousity, you begin to wonder who that disheveled
        fellow is that is glaring back at you with unabashed malice. What did you ever do to deserve
        such scorn? You cannot recall anything past the grogginess that is front and center. You can't
        even bring your name to light.

        A gush of lukewarm water is released when your hands move in front of the faucet. You bend
        down and splash some handfuls onto your face. A name surfaces in your mind: Wallis Finbar.
        It sounds like it belongs to a moron, so you assume it must be yours.

        It takes some effort, but you manage to scrape off a layer of plaque off your chompers. You
        remember you're a deliveryman of some sort. Kitchen appliances? Sausages? Cars! Yes! But not
        ground transportation. This is the future, and you're responsible for driving affordable
        intergalatic starships to the men, creatures or artificial lifeforms that needs them most.
